  priority: "HIGH"
});
```

#### **2. Route Optimization & Dispatch**
```typescript
// Optimize routes and dispatch vehicles

  shipments: pendingShipments,
  availableVehicles: fleetVehicles,
  availableDrivers: qualifiedDrivers,
  objectives: ["MINIMIZE_COST", "MAXIMIZE_EFFICIENCY", "MEET_TIME_WINDOWS"]
});

// Auto-dispatch high-confidence routes
await autoDispatchShipments({
  dispatchPlan: optimization.routes,
  notifyCustomers: true,
  notifyDrivers: true
});
```

#### **3. Real-time Tracking**
```typescript
// Start real-time tracking with geofence monitoring
await startTransportation(shipmentId, currentLocation);

// Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
const trackingSession = await realTimeShipmentTrackingWorkflow({
  shipmentId: shipment.shipmentId,
  trackingInterval: 60, // seconds
  alertThresholds: {
    delayMinutes: 30,
    routeDeviationMiles: 5,
    speedViolationMph: 75
  }
});
```

### **Geofencing & Compliance**

#### **Automated Geofence Creation**
```typescript
// Create pickup geofence
const pickupGeofence = await createGeofence({
  name: "Pickup Zone - Main Depot",
  type: "CIRCULAR",
  coordinates: [{ latitude: 29.7604, longitude: -95.3698 }],
  radius: 500, // meters
  purpose: "PICKUP",
  rules: [
    {
      condition: "ENTER",
      action: "AUTOMATIC_UPDATE",
      recipients: ["dispatch", "customer"],
      priority: "HIGH"
    }
  ]
});
```

#### **Route Deviation Detection**
```typescript
// Automatic route deviation handling
const violations = await checkGeofenceViolations(vehicleId, currentLocation);

if (violations.length > 0) {
  // Handle restricted area entry
  await processGeofenceEvent(vehicleId, geofenceId, "ENTER");
  
  // Auto-recalculate route if needed
  await recalculateRoute(shipmentId, currentLocation);
}
```
